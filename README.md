# podcasts.
This is the list of podcasts that I have in PocketCasts on my android
phone.

The exported opml file from PocketCasts is
available  [here](podcasts_opml.xml).

I have also generated a [table](podcasts.org) that list each podcast, with its related
url. You should be able to use this to import individual podcasts into
your podcast app.

If you would like me to add any podcasts to the list, please create an
Issue in Github with the podcast url and brief description.
